# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the AWS web hosting infrastructure for the Flutter application.

## Security Architecture Overview

The security implementation follows AWS Well-Architected Framework security pillar principles and implements defense-in-depth strategies across multiple layers:

1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
2. **Network Security**
3. **Data Protection**
4. **Infrastructure Security**
5. **Application Security**
6. **Monitoring and Logging**

## Security Controls Implemented

### 1. Identity and Access Management

#### GitHub Actions OIDC Authentication
- **Implementation**: Uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) instead of long-lived access keys
- **Benefits**: Eliminates the need to store AWS credentials as secrets
- **Configuration**: 
  ```yaml
  role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
  role-session-name: GitHubActions-WebHostingDeploy-${{ github.run_id }}
  ```

#### Least Privilege IAM Roles
- **Principle**: Each role has minimal permissions required for its function
- **Implementation**: Custom IAM policies with resource-level restrictions
- **Roles Created**:
  - GitHub Actions deployment role
  - Cross-account DNS management role
  - CloudFront Origin Access Control

#### Cross-Account Security
- **External ID**: Required for cross-account role assumption
- **Time-limited Sessions**: Maximum 1-2 hour session duration
- **Account Restrictions**: Trust policies limited to specific AWS accounts

### 2. Network Security

#### CloudFront Security Headers
Comprehensive security headers implemented:

```typescript
// Content Security Policy
"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob:; ..."

// Security Headers
"Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload"
"X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff"
"X-Frame-Options": "DENY"
"X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block"
"Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"

// Modern Security Headers
"Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp"
"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin"
"Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy": "same-origin"
"Permissions-Policy": "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()"
```

#### HTTPS Enforcement
- **CloudFront**: Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- **HSTS**: Strict Transport Security with 2-year max-age
- **TLS Version**: Minimum TLS 1.2, prefer TLS 1.3

#### Origin Access Control (OAC)
- **Modern Security**: Uses OAC instead of deprecated Origin Access Identity (OAI)
- **S3 Protection**: S3 bucket completely blocked from public access
- **CloudFront Only**: Content only accessible through CloudFront distribution

### 3. Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- **S3 Encryption**: 
  - Development/Staging: S3-managed encryption (SSE-S3)
  - Production: KMS encryption (SSE-KMS) with customer-managed keys
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation enabled for KMS keys
- **CloudFront**: Uses AWS managed certificates with automatic renewal

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS Everywhere**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.2+
- **Certificate Management**: ACM certificates with automatic renewal
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Supported cipher suites only

#### S3 Bucket Security Policies
Multiple bucket policies enforce security:

```typescript
// Deny insecure connections
"aws:SecureTransport": "false" -> DENY

// Deny unencrypted uploads
"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": not present -> DENY

// Deny public ACLs
"s3:x-amz-acl": "public-read*" -> DENY
```

### 4. Infrastructure Security

#### S3 Bucket Hardening
- **Public Access**: Completely blocked at bucket level
- **Versioning**: Enabled for rollback capability
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old versions
- **Access Logging**: Enabled in production environments
- **MFA Delete**: Recommended for production buckets

#### CloudFront Security Configuration
- **Price Class**: Optimized per environment (security vs. cost)
- **Geo-Restrictions**: Can be configured per environment
- **WAF Integration**: Ready for Web Application Firewall integration
- **Real-time Logs**: Available for security monitoring

#### Resource Tagging
Comprehensive tagging for security and compliance:
- `Environment`: dev/staging/prod
- `Component`: Resource type and purpose
- `SecurityLevel`: Classification level
- `DataClassification`: Data sensitivity level
- `Owner`: Responsible team/individual

### 5. Application Security

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
Tailored for Flutter web applications:
- **Script Sources**: Allows necessary inline scripts for Flutter
- **Style Sources**: Permits required inline styles
- **Image Sources**: Restricts to self, data URLs, and blob URLs
- **Connect Sources**: Limits API connections to HTTPS only
- **Frame Protection**: Prevents clickjacking attacks

#### CORS Configuration
Environment-specific CORS policies:
- **Development**: Allows localhost origins
- **Production**: Restricted to specific domains only
- **Methods**: Only GET and HEAD allowed
- **Headers**: Minimal required headers only

#### Input Validation
- **Domain Names**: Regex validation for proper format
- **File Types**: Validation of uploaded asset types
- **File Sizes**: Limits on asset sizes to prevent abuse

### 6. Monitoring and Security Logging

#### CloudWatch Integration
- **RUM Monitoring**: Real user monitoring for security events
- **Custom Metrics**: Security-related metrics collection
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for security events

#### Access Logging
- **CloudFront Logs**: Detailed access logs in production
- **S3 Access Logs**: Bucket access logging enabled
- **CloudTrail**: API call logging for audit trail

#### Security Scanning
Automated security scanning in CI/CD:
```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
npm audit --audit-level=high

# CDK security validation
npx cdk-nag --app "npx ts-node src/app.ts"

# Asset security scanning
grep -r "api[_-]key\|secret\|password" build/
```
