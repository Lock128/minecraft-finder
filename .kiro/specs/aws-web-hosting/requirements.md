# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create AWS infrastructure using CDK in TypeScript to host the Flutter web application on S3 behind CloudFront, with automated deployment via GitHub Actions and monitoring through CloudWatch RUM. The solution will provide a scalable, secure, and monitored web hosting environment for the Ore & Structure Finder application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my Flutter web application to AWS using infrastructure as code, so that I can have a reproducible and version-controlled hosting environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
2. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a CloudFront distribution that serves content from the S3 bucket
3. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL configure proper caching headers for Flutter web assets
4. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL use the latest AWS CDK version in TypeScript
5. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL output the CloudFront distribution URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment through GitHub Actions, so that my web application is automatically deployed when I push changes to the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger a GitHub Actions workflow
2. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the system SHALL build the Flutter web application
3. WHEN the Flutter build completes THEN the system SHALL deploy the built assets to the S3 bucket
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL invalidate the CloudFront cache
5. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use proper AWS credentials securely stored in GitHub secrets
6. WHEN the workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail the deployment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to monitor user interactions and performance of the web application, so that I can understand user behavior and identify performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a CloudWatch RUM application monitor
2. WHEN users visit the web application THEN the system SHALL collect real user monitoring data
3. WHEN RUM is configured THEN the system SHALL track page load times, JavaScript errors, and user interactions
4. WHEN RUM data is collected THEN the system SHALL make it available in CloudWatch dashboards
5. WHEN the Flutter web app loads THEN the system SHALL initialize the RUM client with proper configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper security configurations for the hosting infrastructure, so that the application is served securely and follows AWS best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is created THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS redirects
2. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN the system SHALL block public access except through CloudFront
3. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is configured THEN the system SHALL use Origin Access Control (OAC) instead of deprecated OAI
4. WHEN security headers are configured THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
5. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL follow AWS security best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CDK infrastructure to be maintainable and follow best practices, so that it can be easily updated and managed over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CDK code is written THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. WHEN the CDK stack is structured THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into logical constructs
3. WHEN the CDK code is deployed THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configurations
4. WHEN the infrastructure is created THEN the system SHALL include proper resource tagging
5. WHEN the CDK code is written THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation and comments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cost optimization for the hosting infrastructure, so that the application runs efficiently without unnecessary expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 bucket is configured THEN the system SHALL use appropriate storage classes
2. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is configured THEN the system SHALL use cost-effective caching strategies
3. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL include cost allocation tags
4. WHEN RUM is configured THEN the system SHALL use sampling to control monitoring costs
5. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL optimize for the expected traffic patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to serve the application through a custom domain (subdomain of orefinder.lockhead.cloud), so that users can access it through a branded URL with proper SSL certificate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create an SSL certificate in us-east-1 region for the custom domain
2. WHEN the SSL certificate is created THEN the system SHALL validate it by adding DNS records to Route53 in a different AWS account using cross-account role assumption
3. WHEN the certificate is validated THEN the system SHALL configure the CloudFront distribution to use the custom domain and certificate
4. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a Route53 DNS record pointing the subdomain to the CloudFront distribution in the external AWS account
5. WHEN cross-account operations are performed THEN the system SHALL assume the appropriate IAM role in the DNS management account
6. WHEN the custom domain is configured THEN the system SHALL ensure the subdomain is properly configured under the existing lockhead.cloud hosted zone with the URL orefinder.lockhead.cloud
