# App Store Review Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Guideline 4.1 - Design - Copycats
**Problem**: App name and metadata contained "Minecraft" references

**Solution**: Completely removed all Minecraft references:
- ✅ App name changed from "Minecraft Ore Finder" to "Gem, Ore & Struct Finder for MC"
- ✅ Package/Bundle ID kept as original `cloud.lockhead.minecraft_finder`
- ✅ Updated all display names in iOS Info.plist and Android manifest
- ✅ Updated pubspec.yaml metadata and keywords
- ✅ Updated main app class names and titles
- ✅ Updated README and documentation
- ✅ Updated guide text to use "block-based games" instead of "Minecraft"

### 2. Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed
**Problem**: Apple needed information about data collection practices

**Solution**: Created comprehensive privacy documentation:
- ✅ Created detailed PRIVACY_POLICY.md
- ✅ Created APP_STORE_RESPONSE.md with specific answers to Apple's questions
- ✅ Documented that the app has NO third-party analytics
- ✅ Documented that the app has NO advertising
- ✅ Documented that NO data is shared with third parties
- ✅ Explained minimal local storage (only user preferences)

## Next Steps for App Store Resubmission

1. **Build and Test**: Ensure the app builds correctly with new package names
2. **Update App Store Connect**: 
   - Update app name to "Gem, Ore & Struct Finder for MC"
   - Update description to remove Minecraft references
   - Update keywords to remove "minecraft"
3. **Submit Privacy Response**: Use the content from `APP_STORE_RESPONSE.md` to respond to Apple's questions
4. **Resubmit**: Upload new build with version 1.0.37+

## Key Changes Summary
- **No more Minecraft references** anywhere in the app
- **Clear privacy stance**: No data collection, no third-party services
- **Generic terminology**: Uses "block-based games" and "world generation"
- **Maintained functionality**: All features work exactly the same

The app now focuses on being a "Gem, Ore & Struct Finder for MC" tool using the recognizable "MC" abbreviation while avoiding full trademark references, which should resolve both App Store review issues.
